        <p>It’s kind of obvious in retrospective, but I try to pay attention when I’m writing something on the internet.</p>
<p>For example, sharing my Emacs configuration made me realize I had a few hacks in place and I felt dirty sharing those. I took some time to rework the hacks and that resulted in improving my configuration and making it more maintainable.</p>
<p>The same thing happens when I try to explain an idea to someone or when I make a presentation at work. I try to explain my ideas in the most intelligible way possible and that’s often when I realize I don’t grasp the idea fully and am unable to explain at least some part of it.</p>
<p>In other words, writing is like having a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for being my rubber duck.</p>

<p>I hope you will gain something from reading my blog posts. If you do, or do not, I’d love to hear about it!</p>
