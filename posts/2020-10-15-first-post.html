        <p>I wanted to start writing a blog since a long time. I like sharing my knowledge so it seemed like a good idea. Time will tell! I needed a way to write blog posts and publish them so I searched for a tool that could suite me.</p>
<p>There are a few subjects I want to share about but being a programmer, talking about code and sharing code snippets seemed natural. This is often the missing feature for blogging tools or services. Also, I’m an engineer at heart so I like to build things myself, or at least know I’m able to modify the tools I use to my heart’s content. I searched for some DIY alternatives to online services and found Hakyll. It seemed like the perfect fix because I wanted to write about a language I fell in love with, Haskell.</p>
<p>So here we are, this is my first blog post, what can I write about? Let’s talk about how to setup a blog similar to this one. This is my freshest project anyway.</p>
<p>First caveat, I cannot yet publish this blog post because I’ve got nowhere to publish it! It’s all local. Next blog post will explain how to setup a Hakyll blog using nix… locally. The blog post after that will finally talk about how to publish. And then you’ll be able to read this, hooray.</p>
<p>The stack used to for this blog is Hakyll on top of Haskell and nix. I really like how Nix makes development environments fully reproducible. It’s not easy to setup nor understand so it’s for sure a big investment.</p>
