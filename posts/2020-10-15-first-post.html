        <p>I wanted to start writing a blog since a long time. I like sharing my knowledge so it seems like a good idea. Time will tell!</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m a programmer so it’s natural for me to want to share code snippets. There are other subjects I want to share about but code snippets is often the missing feature for blogging tools or services. Also, I’m an engineer at heart so I like to build things myself. I searched for some DIY alternatives to online services and found Hakyll. It seems like the perfect fix because I want to write about a language I fell in love with, Haskell.</p>
<p>So here we are, this is my first blog post, what can I write about? Let’s talk about how to setup a blog similar to this one. This is my freshest project anyway.</p>
<p>First caveat, I cannot yet publish this blog post because I’ve got nowhere to publish it! It’s all local. This blog post will explain how to setup a Hakyll blog using nix… locally. Next blog post will talk about how to publish. And then you’ll be able to read this, finally.</p>
<p>The stack is Hakyll on top of Haskell and nix. I really like that development environments setup with nix are fully reproducible. It’s not easy to setup nor to understand how Nix works though, so it’s an investment.</p>
